Bugs fixed/modifications:

1. Bound toggleLocked function in the constructor in Game component.
2. TypeError when click on large straight, method evalRoll was missing in ScoreTable.js, on RuleRow for LargeStraight.

TODO 
1. Can lock dice before first roll
2. Should reset rolls after score selected
3. After pick score doesn't reroll, sometimes does... whahhttt is going on?
